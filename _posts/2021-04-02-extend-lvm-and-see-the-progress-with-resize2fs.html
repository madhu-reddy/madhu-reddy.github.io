```
`lvextend -L +100G /dev/sda2`
```

```
`resize2fs -p /dev/sda2 `
```

***-p option**** ---> Prints out a percentage completion bars for each ****resize2fs**** operation, so that the user can keep track of what the program is doing*

```
`resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/sda2 to 26214400 
(4k) blocks.
Begin pass 2 (max = 5713)
Relocating blocks         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Begin pass 3 (max = 1480)
Scanning inode table      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Begin pass 4 (max = 1547)|
Updating inode references XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
The filesystem on /dev/sda2 is now 26214400 blocks long.`
```

This is very helpful, especially when the partition resizing size is significant, taking a few minutes to complete the resize. This helps to avoid confusion about whether the command is hung or not.
