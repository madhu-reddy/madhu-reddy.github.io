# PermitRootLogin:

The **PermitRootLogin** options solely determine whether direct login as the root user via SSH to the server is permissible.

The valid arguments for this directive are: **no**, **yes**, **forced-commands-only**, and **without-password**.

**NOTE:
**The **without-password** option has been deprecated and, in newer versions of OpenSSH 7.0 and above, **prohibit-password** is used instead.

- **PermitRootLogin without-password (or **PermitRootLogin prohibit-password****)**: 
**This setting permits root login exclusively through public key authentication. It's commonly employed for shell scripts and automated tasks.

- **PermitRootLogin no: 
** Prohibits direct root logins to the server (although subsequent root login via "**su -**" is possible after initially logging in as a regular user).

- **PermitRootLogin yes**: 
Enables direct root logins.

- **PermitRootLogin****forced-commands-only**: 
Allows public key authentication, but only if the command option has been specified. This might be beneficial for remote backups, even if all possible methods for root login aren't permitted.

                                                       
                  

# PasswordAuthentication:

The** PasswordAuthentication** option informs us whether users can access the server using their password or not.

The acceptable arguments are limited to "**no**" and "**yes**," with the default setting being "**yes**."

A.** PasswordAuthentication yes: **This enables password authentication (this option should correspond with **UsePAM** set to "**yes**").

B**.** **PasswordAuthentication no: **This disables password authentication, permitting login solely with the public key. This setting should be complemented by **ChallengeResponseAuthentication** set to "**no**" and **PubkeyAuthentication** set to "**yes**."
