## [Changing the default data directory in a TeamCity server, would require the following steps

1) First Stop the TeamCity server with the following command,
/opt/jetbrains/TeamCity/bin/runAll.sh stop

2) Copy all the files and directories with the same permissions,  from the default data directory "**/root/.BuildServer**" to the directory which we want to be the new data directory "**/opt/teamcity-data**".

3) Edit the file "**teamcity-startup.properties**" & set the "**teamcity.data.path**"  to "**/opt/teamcity-data**".

4) Now Start the TeamCity Server(/opt/jetbrains/TeamCity/bin/runAll.sh start)

5) Now, open the TeamCity GUI and verify that the data directory has been updated to "**/opt/teamcity-data**". Consequently, all data related to "**artifacts**" will be stored within the "**/opt/teamcity-data**" directory going forward.
